## Introduction

---

**Good news, don‚Äôt forget what you know already.**

See this as a new set of skills and build on this...

---?image=https://i.imgflip.com/p8blw.jpg&size=auto auto

--- 

Similar to web design, it‚Äôs wide and dense, like huge but interesting.

But it's still designing so you‚Äôll still need inspiration as well as all of your best skills especially for UX and UI.

---

**(Try to) Be interested and curious**

It‚Äôs okay to be new on something as long as you try to understand it and do your best.

---

**My personal first experiences...**

Using Appcelerator Titanium...

## Different ways (and technologies) to build mobile applications

---

**iOS Native Development**

Objective-C or Swift language + iOS SDK + XCode as IDE + CocoaPods as Dependancy Manager
    
---

**Android Native Development**

Java language + Android SDK + Android Studio as IDE + Gradle as Dependancy Manager
    
---

Those two can't be any closer from the OS + native SDK

---

**Hybrid Development**

- React Native (Javascript)
- Appcelerator Titanium (Javascript)
- Xamarin (C# + Microsoft .Net platform)

---

- performances: very close from native üëç
- can access most of the device capabilities
- target both iOS and Android (and sometimes Windows Phones too)
- re-usable codebase
- more accessible languages
- but with some limitations

--- 

**Web App Development** AKA "App Shelling"

- PhoneGap (Cordova)
- SenchaTouch
- Ion

Encapsulate a website (including RWD or not) into a mobile applciation.

---

- performances are üí©
- depending on HTML/CSS/Javascript
- can't access all device capabilities

--- 

**But no matter what, it's all going to the same place**

- Apple App Store
- Android Play Store

^ Good news for designers. ‚ù§Ô∏è

---

- Same distribution
- Same platform constraints
- Same challanges

---

## Considerations

---

**Good news, don‚Äôt forget what you know**

- UI Design Skills
- UX Design Skills
- Wireframing Skills
- Same tools...

---

**But wait, what are you building this for?**

Another good news: the same things! üéâ 

---

**A Machine and a User**

True ‚ù§Ô∏è story.

---

### A machine

Some technical considerations from a Designer POV

---

**Websites**

Any **Browser** which is going to run the website using one or multiple **Resolutions** (RWD or not),

---

**Mobile Applications**

- Device (hardware)
- Operating System
- Connectivity

---

**Device - Resolution(s)**

- Standards for iOS based on original 320x480
- Different resolutions **4** based on screen sizes (5.5‚Äù | 4.7‚Äù | 4‚Äù | 3.5‚Äù)
- Android uses standards like HVGA, WVGA800 or WVGA854

---

**What resolution(s) should we use for our designs?**

Discussion...

---

### A user

---

**User Input is different from a website**

- Multiple touch gestures:
    - **tap** (not click) + position
    - **double tap** + position
    - **swipe** + direction + position
    - **pinch** + direction
    - **drag** + direction

---

- Typing on a small keyboard (slower text typing)
    - ‚Üù ask for the very minimum
    - ‚Üù ask for relevant things
- Learn the terminology:
    - Page = Screen
    - Click = Tap/Touch
    - App Icon
    - Splash Screens‚Ä¶

---

## Wireframes

- Good to start on paper but needs to be digital at some point
- Like a website, prep work is mandatory...

---

**Apply the same concepts from a website**
    
- Brand guidelines
- Business Requirements
- Client Requirements
- User Interface and Interactions should be illustrated if needed within the wireframe

---

**Application Definition Statement**
        
- What the application experience is
- What is the application meant to do
- Who is the intended audience

---

**Feedback, touch gestures and transitions**

Always feedback to the user

‚Üù confirm correct behaviour + satisfaction + avoid confusion

---

**Visual Feedback at least**

- touch states
- animation upon completion of action
- communicate with literals upon completion of action

(audio or vibration feedback can be used too)

---

User interaction is different from a website (multiple touch gestures...)

Always keep in mind the context (connectivity) and limitations from a user POV

Don't forget transitions between screen and animations.

---

## UI Design

---

**Most of Design Principles still apply**

- User centric
- Less is more
- Actions are keys
- Be consistent
- and many more I‚Äôm sure‚Ä¶

---

Sketch is a must (vector is ‚ù§Ô∏è) proper UI design tool

---

Resolutions and densities

Responsiveness of a mobile application

---

**Design Guidelines**

- Apple Human Interface Guidelines
- Google Material Design Guidelines

or other (Windows Phones)

---

**Know the UI Elements/Components**

Buttons, TableView/ListView, ScrollableView, ScrollView, ImageView, View, Slider, Dialog, Picker, Window, Inputs...

---

**Know how iOS / Android handle differences**

---

**Units, Layout, Positioning and View Hierarchy**

Units for Absolute values:

- Default iOS: dip
- Default Android: pixels 
- Possibilities: px, mm, cm, in, dp/dip, or system
- dp/dip is recommended

---

**DP/DIP/DPI DAFUQ?**

DPI (Dots Per Inch) = **Physical measure**
DIP (Density Independent Pixels) = **Abstract measure**

---

DIP is also known as:

- Points
- DP (Digital Points)
- PPI (points per inch)

Don't ask. ¬Ø\_(„ÉÑ)_/¬Ø

---

![](http://blog.fluidui.com/content/images/2015/09/resolution.png)

---

- Android: actual pixels = dip * (screen density) / 160
- iOS: actual pixels = dip * (screen density) / 163

Effectively **1dip = 1px** on standard and **1dip = 2px** on retina display for iOS.

---

**Content**
        
- FILL behaviour
- SIZE behaviour
- Absolute values (based on selected unit)
- Percentages (based on parent)

---

**Positionning**

- top, right, bottom, left anchors
- value (percentage or absolute)

---

**Image formats**

- GIF, PNG, JPG supported but JPG for pics and PNG preferred for anything else.
- No SVG supported.
- Image sizes are really important and Developers should be able to tell you for some very specific assets what is the **exact** resolution expected. Hard requirement in some cases.
- Overview of Android 9 patch technique.
- 2 ways of doing splash screens

---

**Navigation** and **Forms** are one of the most challenging things to do

---

- Navigation
    - Windows
    - Explanations around patterns
        - High level
            - Sub levels

---

- Forms
    - Elements
    - Feedback
    - Textarea example
    - Checkbox example
    - Date picker example

---

Use symbols to avoid having to repeat yourself, especially for UI elements

---

Try to build your own library (or modify an existing one to match the project) but having standards and avoid repetition is key. Similar to what we do for websites with [Styleguide | Cyber-Duck](http://patterns.cyberduck.net/)

---

- Typography
- Buttons
- Form elements
- Screen layouts (templates)
- Screen elements
- and many more‚Ä¶

---

Don‚Äôt forget empty states.

Don‚Äôt forget transitions, make it live (but not too much)
    - Push Notification example

---

**Always test your UI**

- Things should be touchable
- UX needs to be good 

---

**Deliverables**

---

## Don‚Äôt reinvent the wheel

---

Past: Photoshop + Smart Object

---

- Now Sketch Files/Libraries + Symbols
- Tools (App Icons, Splash screens‚Ä¶)
- Libraries (UI Libraries for example)

---

- [App Icon Templates](https://savvyapps.com/blog/sketch-ios-app-icon-template)
- [App Icon Sketch Files](https://www.sketchappsources.com/free-source/2183-ios-android-app-icon-generator-sketch-freebie-resource.html)
- Splash Screens Sketch Files...
- sketchappsources.com + Google 

Question about Git [https://github.com/jtholloran/icons](https://github.com/jtholloran/icons)

---

## Designers and Developers should talk a lot.

As always.

---

Gather technical requirements from Developers.

Make sure you book recurrent times to review things.

Thing are coming as requirements from the technology used.

---

- For a functionality
- For the UI
- For connectivity

---

- For feeding back the user on errors
    - While filling a form or performing an action
    - While simply navigating and using the application
- What units to talk to?
- What densities?


---

Make sure to have a lot of checkpoints with your Developers to approve what has been produced (wireframes, designs, functionalities‚Ä¶)

---

In sum, apply the same things you would apply for a website in terms of workflow, checkpoints and processes.
